# H1 Welcome to War!

### H3 This game is very simplistic in how it works!

### If you're not familiar with the game of War, this is how it works. You and the computer are both dealt one card. Whoever has the higher card wins. If your cards are even in the beginning, then you press HIT to recieve another card.

## The Rules

Press Deal to begin the game.

The game will then run the function and compare your cards, whoever has the highest card wins!

If it is a draw then you press hit to draw another card.
